## React/Redux TodoMVC
After watching the videos from [Dan Abramov's Getting Started With Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux), I decided to try to build the React/Redux Todo App with the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) template and stylesheet. This covers through around video 22 after extracting stateless components, and was done from memory or my own thoughts in order to reinforce what I learned in the videos.
