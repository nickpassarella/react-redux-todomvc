# React/Redux TodoMVC
After watching the videos from [Dan Abramov's Getting Started With Redux](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux), I decided to try to build the React/Redux Todo App with the [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) template and stylesheet. This code differs slightly from the video code due to the slightly different specs of the TodoMVC template vs the simple todo app in the videos (e.g. 'Clear all completed', and showing a count of active todos, as well as the different input style).

This was built mostly from memory and my own decisions after watching the videos to reinforce the lessons.
